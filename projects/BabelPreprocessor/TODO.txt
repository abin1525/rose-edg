DONE * SIDL function names can't be overloaded, at present we need don't have a mechanism to
  detect which function names are overloaded.

* Internal_Index operatorMinus(); should be names operatorUnaryMinus
  Need to detect that the number of operands is 0 (so it is not a binary operator).

* Destructors and constructors (member functions) likely need to have specific names defined by SIDL
  (need to ask Babel team).

* Need to be able to traverse class declarations not in the input file so that we can simplify the
  generation of SIDL files from C++ libraries.

* Not clear how to handle function pointers (I supect that BABLE does not permit this).

* Not clear how to handle errors (such as attempt to generate the SIDL output from a function using
  a function pointer as a function parameter).

* Not clear how to specify specific functions as the interface to be represented in SIDL.

DONE * forward class declarations seem to generate nested SIDL class declarations

* Remaining work for initial release:

    Too much to list at this point in development.
