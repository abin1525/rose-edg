How to use Maple:

1) The C interface to Maple is broken, so althogh it is ultimately the best solution
we can't use it yet.

2) Use an alternative file interface.
    A. Accumulate all the equations into a single file for batch processing


    B. Process one equation at a time (this is more like the C interface and is slower but
    easier to migrate to the C interface later).
        1.  Generate a file with the equation

            a. For Cache Miss Equations:
                cacheMissEquation0x00001_0x00002 := ( ((j+1)*n+(i)) - ((j-1)*n+(i-1)) );



            b. For Loop Trip Equations:
                loopEquation0x00003 := sum(block0x0004+condition0x0008+increment0x009,index0x0005=base0x0006..bound0x0007);

        2. Run through maple using script:

          ROSE writes file
          system call to maple with script: system(maple script)
          script reads file
          simplifies the equation
          outputs simplified equation to new file
          ROSE reads new file and saves the equation as a string.

       3. Example script       
           # Read the file containing the equation
           read "loopTripEquation";
           # simplify the equation
           simplify( loop_trip_equation );
           # write the simplified equation to a file
           save loop_trip_equation, "simplifiedLoopTripEquation";


3) Counting access patterns
     Use locality of accesses to desgin patterns.
