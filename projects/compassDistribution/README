Welcome to Compass

This is a tool for the analysis of source code.
It permist the specification of rules and detects the
violation of the rules in the source code.

Rules can be specified using any of the program analysis
techniques within the ROSE project.  Most examples are
shown as the detection of patterns on the AST.

ROSE is an open compiler infrastructure for the development 
of source-to-source tools for C, C++, and Fortran (but the
Fortran is support is still in the works and a collaboration
with Los Alamos).

Files in this distribution:

1) Compass.patch: a patch to run on the ROSE source tree (for any version of ROSE)

2) compass.tar.gz: the source code for Compass, which should be untared to the
                ROSE/projects directory and will build the ROSE/projects/compass
                directory.  This file contains most of the rules defined as of
                8/10/2007.  README files in this directory example how to compile
                compass, but the basics are the rerun "build", rerun "configure",
                and run "make".

3) COMPASS_SUBMIT.tar.gz: This is the Compass checker submission directory, it 
                contains all the checkers that have been submitted (and the 
                scripts to copy them into the ROSE/projects/compass directory).
                Scripts here support:
                   1) generation of the code template to build a new checker.
                   2) the submit script to submit checkers (as a tarball) to compass.
                   3) the script to assemble the submitted checkers into compass
                      (into ROSE/projects/compass).

4) README:  This README file.
