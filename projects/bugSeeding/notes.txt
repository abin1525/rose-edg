Bug Seeding Design

1) Identify top 30-40 bugs

2) Security flaws will be refered to as more general bugs.
The development of seeding for bugs is addressed for 
simple bugs, bug chains and bug collections.  We define these
according to discussions at NIST of work byu MITRE.
   * A simple bug is defined as isolated single bugs
   * A bug chains is a sequential set of conditions each of which 
     may or may not be a bug.
   * A bug collection is a set of conditions each of which may or 
     may not be a bug and which colectively for a bug.

bugSeeding.tex   For each target bug:
    a) For simple bugs (not a part of a bug collection or bug chain)
         1. Identify the space of transformations to represent the target bug
         2. Define the set of points in the space to evaluate

    b) For bug chains
         1. Identify each link in the bug chain (need more discussion about this)
         2. Define the set of points in the space to evaluate

    c) For bug collections
         1. Identify element of the bug collection (need more discussion about this)
         2. Define the set of points in the space to evaluate

Note that it might be that parts 2b and 2c can be addressed by reusing
part 2a and expanding the space to include all permutations defined
buy the bug chain and/or the bug collection.
