1) Documentation generation appears to not always get the function parameters correct.
    This might be due to hashing on the function name instead of hashing on the function's
    mangled name.

For example:
/*!\fn std::list < SgInitializedName * , std::allocator< SgInitializedName * > > ::iterator SgFunctionDeclaration::append_arg(class ::SgInitializedName *what)
\todo Document this
\param element \todo Document the element parameter
\param what \todo Document the what parameter
*/
this class has a member function:
          SgInitializedNamePtrList::iterator append_arg  ( SgInitializedName* element );
But only the SgFunctionCallExp class has a member function:
          void append_arg(SgExpression* what);
It appears that the documentation generation generates documentation for the union 
of the two.


Note:
   Building the sage specific header files is done using the following command:
   generateDocsHeaderFile ../../docs/testDoxygen sage_doxygen_documentation.h "*.docs"


2) Doxygen appears to give preference to the non-defining declaration that appears in the
   class and where the non-defining and the defining declarations don't match in parameter
   names the documentation matches agains the non-defining declaration from the class.
   Or maybe just the declaration in the class.  But the generated documentation uses the
   defining declaration and so the matching required for member group selection does not
   work properly.

3) Friend functions don't appear to be handled.  It seems likely that any deprecated
   friends would missing being added to the depricated group.

4) Kill the automated doxygen todo declaration, please.
