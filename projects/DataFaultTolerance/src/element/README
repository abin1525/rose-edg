This folder contains code which worked upon per array element instead of a chunk of elements.
SECDED (Single Error Correction Double Error Detection) is used for calculating the parity bits.
The code worked by hashing the address of array element alongwith the parity bits and storing
in a hash table. Later based on the accesses, the parity bits are verified.

Currently, this code is kept for future reference. ( Kamal 08/09/2011 )
