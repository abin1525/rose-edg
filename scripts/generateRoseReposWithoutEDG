# A script to strip off EDG and EDG_SAGE_CONNECTION directories from 
# the original ROSE repository and prepare a fresh clean ROSE to be mirrored 
# to an external svn repository
#
# Caveat: this method may not be robust for two reasons: 
# Reason 1:
# 'svnadmin dump -rv1:head' may cause 'svnadmin load' fail, there may be some revisions
# which depend on a revision before v1 to be replayed. 
#
# e.g. Error message
#     Relative source revision -29 is not available in current repository
# So choose the start revision carefully.
# Reason 2:  
#    The official svndumpfilter is buggy, a third party replacement script is used
