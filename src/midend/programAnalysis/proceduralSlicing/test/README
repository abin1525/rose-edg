The files in this directory is for testing the slicing classes:


1)
First we compile the slicing classes and get the application for doing the slicing:

make -f Makefile_slice

This gives us the application ./slice (which in turn is called by ./test_slice, the next application).
./slice takes a code with pragma declarations and a number (1 or 3) giving the "interface", as input.
(Slicing classes are in the directory "below" ../, while the slicing application ./slice is placed in the current directory.)

2)
Compile the next application:

make -f Makefile_test

This produces ./test_slice. This application take as input a code without pragma declarations. For all the statements in the code, the application inserts pragma declarations around every statement, compiles and runs the code, then slices the code (with the above application ./slice), then the sliced code is compiled and run, before the output of the two applications are compared to see if the slicing is correct.

3)
Finally,

g++ drivermain.cpp -o run_tests

The application ./run_tests has the list of files to be tested in an array and for each of the files, calls the ./test_slice application with the file.

4)
We now run
> ./run_tests
to the the slicing...

The directory inputfiles/ contains all the inputfiles which ./run_tests uses.
