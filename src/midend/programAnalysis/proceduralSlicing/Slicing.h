\class Slicing
 This class controls the different parts of the slicing process: From the input of a SgProject object to the removal of nodes.

The slicing is divided into the following steps:
-# Identifying the slicing criterion, that is the statements we are doing slicing on. These statements are placed between pragma declarations.
\sa SlicingCriterion

-# Identify the function definition is which the slicing cirterion is. These two first steps are done in the function "init". \sa init.

-# Finding the statements which affect the slicing criterion, using the Definition Use Chain. This is done in the function "onlyStmts" which uses the class FindStatements.
\sa onlyStmts, FindStatements

-# Marking nodes in the AST is done in a traversal "MarkingNodes". If a node is in the set of statements necessary for the slice, then we mark the node with a AST attribute. At the same time we collect statements from the control statements which we might need to do a slicing on. Then we have to do the previous step one more time for these statements and then this traversal of marking as well. This is done in the function "addControlStmts". We also collect the functions that are called within the slice. Later the functions that are not needed for the slice are removed. This last part is done in the function "keepNeededFunc".
\sa MarkingNodes, addControlStmts, keepNeededFunc.

-# When we have found all statements necessary for the slice and also marked the nodes in the AST, then we are ready to remove the AST nodes which are not marked to be kept, and thus not needed for the slice.
\sa RemovalOfNodes
