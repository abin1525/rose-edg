Subject: automated mysql test


Hi Dan,

This is fixed check target for the database tests.

The most important step was to add a 'sleep 1' to ensure the server has
enough time to startup before issuing it a command.

I also needed to added '' around the MySQL_password.  Finally, I added the
mysql_zap command to kill the database.

These commands should probably be abstracted into two scripts:

rose-start-db and rose-kill-db

Is it unreasonable to ask "whoever" (be it a person or an automated
system) to call rose-start-db before make check and rose-kill-db
afterwards?  Starting and stopping the server for each test is kludgy and
inefficient.  Starting before the first and killing after the last test
seems fragile.
