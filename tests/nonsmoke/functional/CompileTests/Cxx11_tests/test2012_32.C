// Allow garbage collected implementations

// It is implementation-defined whether unreachable dynamically allocated objects are automatically 
// reclaimed. However C++11 adds a few restrictions to implementations so that some behavior that 
// would prevent garbage collection to work is now disallowed. This includes in particular common 
// ways to "hide" pointers from a possible garbage collector, like applying xor to it.[citation needed]
